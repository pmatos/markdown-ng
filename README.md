# Markdown vs Markdown-ng

Markdown-ng adds support for:

* tables (thanks to [antoineB](https://github.com/antoineB))

# Acknowledgements

* Greg Hendershott

Greg developed racket [markdown](https://github.com/greghendershott/markdown) over many years. However, recently Greg [has stopped maintaining](http://www.greghendershott.com/2019/07/future-of-racket.html) many of his Racket projects. I have decided to fork this project since there are a few handy markdown features I would specifically like to use with [darwin](https://github.com/pmatos/darwin).

I should still point out that this is 99.9% Gregs code. Many thanks for his expertise and years of devotion to this amazing library.
